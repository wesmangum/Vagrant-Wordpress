  # machine versions. Think of it as two different ways to access the same file. When the
  # virtual machine is destroyed with `vagrant destroy`, your files will remain in your local
  # environment.

  # this file is changed or removed, this mapping will no longer occur. A db_backup command
  # is now available inside the virtual machine to backup all databases for future use. This
  # command is automatically issued on halt, suspend, and destroy if the vagrant-triggers
  # plugin is installed.
