# Vagrant Wordpress

A Vagrant installation that comes with a basic wordpress setup

### The First Vagrant Up

1. Start with any local operating system such as Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows.
1. Install [VirtualBox 4.3.x](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
1. Install [Vagrant 1.7.x](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
    * `vagrant` will now be available as a command in your terminal, try it out.
    * ***Note:*** If Vagrant is already installed, use `vagrant -v` to check the version. You may want to consider upgrading if a much older version is in use.
1. Clone or extract this project into a local directory
    * `git clone git://github.com/wesmangum/Vagrant-Wordpress vagrant-wordpress`
1. In a command prompt, change into the new directory with `cd vagrant-wordpress`
1. Start the Vagrant environment with `vagrant up`
    * Be patient as the magic happens. This could take a while on the first run as your local machine downloads the required files.
    * Watch as the script ends, as an administrator or `su` ***password may be required*** to properly modify the hosts file on your local machine.
1. Visit any of the following default sites in your browser:
    * [http://local.wordpress.dev/](http://local.wordpress.dev/)

Fancy, yeah?

### What Did That Do?

The first time you run `vagrant up`, a packaged box containing a basic virtual machine is downloaded to your local machine and cached for future use. The file used by Varying Vagrant Vagrants contains an installation of Ubuntu 14.04 and is about 332MB.

After this box is downloaded, it begins to boot as a sandboxed virtual machine using VirtualBox. Once booted, it runs the provisioning script included with VVV. This initiates the download and installation of around 100MB of packages on the new virtual machine.

The time for all of this to happen depends a lot on the speed of your Internet connection. If you are on a fast cable connection, it will likely only take several minutes.

On future runs of `vagrant up`, the packaged box will be cached on your local machine and Vagrant will only need to apply the requested provisioning.

* ***Preferred:*** If the virtual machine has been powered off with `vagrant halt`, `vagrant up` will quickly power on the machine without provisioning.
* ***Rare:*** If you would like to reapply the provisioning scripts with `vagrant up --provision` or `vagrant provision`, some time will be taken to check for updates and packages that have not been installed.
* ***Very Rare:*** If the virtual machine has been destroyed with `vagrant destroy`, it will need to download the full 100MB of package data on the next `vagrant up`.

### Now What?

Now that you're up and running, start poking around and modifying things.

1. Access the server via the command line with `vagrant ssh` from your `vagrant-wordpress` directory. You can do almost anything you would do with a standard Ubuntu installation on a full server.
1. Power off the box with `vagrant halt` and turn it back on with `vagrant up`.
1. Suspend the box's state in memory with `vagrant suspend` and bring it right back with `vagrant resume`.
1. Reapply provisioning to a running box with `vagrant provision`.
1. Destroy the box with `vagrant destroy`. Files added in the `www` directory will persist on the next `vagrant up`.

#### Caveats

The network configuration picks an IP of 192.168.50.4. It could cause conflicts on your existing network if you *are* on a 192.168.50.x subnet already. You can configure any IP address in the `Vagrantfile` and it will be used on the next `vagrant up`

VVV relies on the stability of both Vagrant and Virtualbox. These caveats are common to Vagrant environments and are worth noting:
* If the directory VVV is inside of is moved once provisioned (`vagrant-wordpress`), it may break.
    * If `vagrant destroy` is used before moving, this should be fine.
* If Virtualbox is uninstalled, VVV will break.
* If Vagrant is uninstalled, VVV will break.

The default memory allotment for the VVV virtual machine is 1024MB. If you would like to raise or lower this value to better match your system requirements, a [guide to changing memory size](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/wiki/Customising-your-Vagrant's-attributes-and-parameters) is in the wiki.

Since version 1.2.0, VVV has used a 64bit version of Ubuntu. Some older CPUs (such as the popular *Intel Core 2 Duo* series) do not support this. Changing the line `config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"` to `"ubuntu/trusty32"` in the `Vagrantfile` before `vagrant up` will provision a 32bit version of Ubuntu that will work on older hardware.

#### WordPress Stable
* LOCAL PATH: vagrant-local/www/wordpress-default
* VM PATH: /srv/www/wordpress-default
* URL: `http://local.wordpress.dev`
* DB Name: `wordpress_default`

#### MySQL Root
* User: `root`
* Pass: `root`
* See: [Connecting to MySQL](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv/wiki/Connecting-to-MySQL) from your local machine
